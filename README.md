# Race-Data-Analyzer
A lightweight graphical interface to display and analyze data collected on the car.

This was created for the purpose of analyzing testing and racing data from RM21,
and is intended to be continuously modified and used with future cars built by
Rensselaer Motorsports. Its goal is to take the data generated from the various
sensors on RM21 and display it in a lightweight, interactive user interface that is
specifically designed to meet the team's needs and help with tuning and improving
the car. This application is built using PyQt4, pyqtgraph, and numpy, and as such
each of these libraries are required to run this software.

Please contact Mitchell Mellone at mellom3@rpi.edu with any questions.
